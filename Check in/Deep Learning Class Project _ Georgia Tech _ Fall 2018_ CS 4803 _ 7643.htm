<!-- Goal -->
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<!-- One or two sentences on the motivation behind the problem you are solving. One or two sentences describing the approach you took. One or two sentences on the main result you obtained. -->
We want to transfer the style of Hip Hop to any audio or music genre. For example, adding in a hip hop style to a classical song sample, or jazz, etc. Sujeeth is taking the approach of using a CNN-RNN architecture and doing style transfer on the Convolutional layers.

This figure shows the architecture for the CNN/RNN model we'll be using for style transfer.

<!-- Introduction -->
<h2>Introduction / Background / Motivation</h2>
<h4>What did you try to do? What problem did you try to solve? Articulate your objectives using absolutely no jargon.</h4>
Sujeeth isn't sure how to go about doing style transfer to the RNN layer, so we're going to see how well just doing it on the Convolutional layers will go, and then see if there's a reasonable way to achieve style transfer with an RNN. The objective is to produce a spectogram that contains the style of a hip hop sample, but the content of the content sample, and then convert the spectogram back into audio.

<h4>How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?</h4>
Currently there are a few approaches involving <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.07575">VAE's and GAN's (1)</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/@suraj.jayakumar/tonenet-a-musical-style-transfer-c0a18903c910">VAE's and GAN's (2)</a>, and <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.07848.pdf">Wavenet Autoencoders</a>.

<h4>Who cares? If you are successful, what difference will it make?</h4>
Style transfering music could help DJs make better blends of beats or transition between music easier.

<!-- Analysis -->
<h2>Analysis</h2>
<h4>Do the results make sense? Why or why not? Describe what kind of visualization/analysis you performed in order to verify that your results 1) are correct and 2) explain differences in performance from what was expected (e.g. what appeared in papers). Provide specific claims about why you think your model is or is not doing better, and justify those with qualitative and quantitative experiments (not necessarily just final accuracy numbers, but statistics or other data about what the model is doing).</h4>
