      <!-- Goal -->
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        For this project, we explored methodologies in style transfer for audio. Style transfer in audio encompasses
        challenges such as taking one genre of music and synthesizing it with traits from another genre.
        We were motivated to pursue this topic for a variety of reasons. First, style transferring music could help DJs
        make
        better blends of beats or transition between music easier.
        Furthermore, production music is a <a target="_blank"
          href="https://variety.com/2017/biz/news/production-music-billion-dollar-business-study-1202563223/">billion-dollar
          industry</a>. These pieces
        are typically placed in the background of marketing media and film. They are often
        simple pieces that could benefit from the extra volume in genre that deep learning like this
        provides.
      </p>
      <h2>Prior Art and Motivation</h2>
      <p>
        Currently, there are several approaches for musical style transfer involving
        <a target="_blank" href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/320754682_Audio_style_transfer">Wide, Shallow
          Convolutional Neural Networks</a>.
        We wanted to compare this pre-existing art with approaches using deeper neural networks.
        Furthermore, there are a few approaches for musical style transfer involving <a target="_blank"
          href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.07575">VAE's and GAN's (1)</a>, <a
          href="https://medium.com/@suraj.jayakumar/tonenet-a-musical-style-transfer-c0a18903c910">VAE's and GAN's
          (2)</a>, and <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.07848.pdf">Wavenet Autoencoders</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        While VAEs and GANs are certainly worth exploring as well, we focused on adding complexity to a shallow
        untrained neural
        net to explore how far this architecture can be pushed.
      </p>

      <h2>Approach</h2>

      <h4>Preprocessing Pipeline</h4>
      <p>
        <div style="text-align: center;">
          <img style="height: 300px;" alt="" src="imgs/STFT_Visualization.png">
        </div>
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>
        All of the architectures followed the same general preprocessing pipeline in order to perform style transfer.
        In order to make convolutional style transfer of a 1-dimensional waveform tractable, we represent audio tracks
        as a 2-dimensional image. This image is produced using a Short Time Fourier Transform (STFT), which
        encodes a long waveform into equal-length segments and computes frequency magnitude and phase content for each
        segment.

          <p>Pipeline used for style transfer.</p>
        </div>
      </p>

      <h4>Architecture 1: Shallow 1D CNN</h4>
      <p>
        The first approach taken to this problem was to apply an untrained, wide 1D-Convolution filter network to the
        time domain signal and run style transfer.
        From a signal-processing perspective, this is essentially extracting a variety of frequency-domain
        characteristics in one signal (albeit without any structure) and attempting to
        transfer them to another signal via gradient descent. This approach quickly failed, with results turning out to
        be very noisy, presumably due to the frequency bands defined by the filters not being clear cut.
      </p>
      <p>
        A 1D approach with slightly better results came from using the spectrogram as a multi-channel sound with each
        frequency band being one channel. This approach, introduced for
        <a target="_blank" href="https://dmitryulyanov.github.io/audio-texture-synthesis-and-style-transfer">audio
          texture synthesis</a> by Ulyanov, was adapted into a PyTorch pipeline. Experimentation with adding in content
        loss resulted in worse results, however.
      </p>

      <h4>Architecture 2: Wide-Shallow 2D CNN</h4>
      <p>
        To establish a baseline for more complexity, a wide-shallow architecture was implemented using the techniques
        in our research of prior art. This involved creating a neural network with one convolution of 4096 filters. As described
        in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/320754682_Audio_style_transfer">Audio Style
          Transfer</a>
        by Grinsten, Duoung, Ozernov, and Perez, an untrained convolutional neural network can actually capture
        components of both the style and content. One can view this architecture as an exploration of whether 2D convolutions
        produces meaningful results, which is a crucial requirement for VGG style transfer to operate.
      </p>

      <p>
        As an extension to the shallow approach, we experimented if adding <i>depth</i> using a pretrained neural network
        would yield better results. Although VGG-19 was pretrained on an extremely different problem set, its ability
        to detect primitives such as edges and basic shapes was hypothesized to be useful, even for spectrogram style transfer.

        This figure shows the architecture for VGG19. We used
        <code>'block1_conv1', 'block2_conv1', 'block3_conv1', 'block4_conv1', 'block5_conv1'</code> for style transfer.
      </p>


      <h2>Experimental Plan</h2>
      <h4>Dataset</h4>
      <p>
        One challenge with style transfer is that there is no objective way to evaluate the success of an output.
        Thus,
        we standardized our evaluation by picking one style sample and one audio sample. For the content sample, we
        utilized
        jazz elevator music from <a target="_blank" href="https://www.bensound.com">Bensound</a>. For the style sample,
        we utilized
        a specifically selected track from the <a target="_blank" href="http://freemusicarchive.org/">GTZAN Genre
          Collection</a>.

        <br>
        <i>(left) BenSound elevator music sample. (right) GTZAN Hip Hop sample.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        These two sources were selected for a variety of reasons. First, the elevator music is primarily instrumental
        while the
        hip hop style source relies on lyrics and percussion. This constrains the difficulty of the style transfer
        since our architectures would not need to deal with issues such as music key differences or colliding vocal
        utterances.
        This also eases the difficulty in subjectively evaluating a style transfer, since it would be very simple to hear
        whether a particular audio artifact comes from the content or style source.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, while there is no standardized way to evaluate a style transfer, we drafted the following scheme
        when rating the output of each architecture:
        <ul>
          <li><b>Human-Equivalent:</b> the outputted audio could plausibly have been created by a human in the desired
            style.</li>
          <li><b>Comprehensible:</b> the outputted audio contains easily-understood lyrics and well-blended instrumental
            artifacts.</li>
          <li><b>Fair:</b> the outputted audio contains some elements from content and style but lacks refinement in how
            they are blended.</li>
          <li><b>Poor:</b> the outputted audio contains some elements from content and style but contains many undesirable
            artifacts.</li>
          <li><b>Incomprehensible:</b> the outputted audio captures neither content nor style and may have degraded to
            random noise.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <h4>Spectrogram Visuzalizations</h4>
      <p>
        <img height="300px" src="imgs/spectrogram_visualizations.png" />
      </p>
      <p>
        The above STFT images were fed into each architecture and then inverted to generate sample audio.
        Clearly, the content audio spectrogram appears very different than the style audio spectrogram.

        Using the experiment scheme described in the experiment plan, we arrived at the following results. The 1D CNN
        gave us the content audio styled to a single set of notes from the style audio, suggesting that some subset of
        the style was transferred. The content, however, was muffled by distortion.
        The Wide-Shallow Baseline contained elements from both content sources, although the instrument mixing
        contains some imperfect artifacts and the lyrics are slightly muffled. Unfortunately, the VGG-19 experiment did
        not
        match our hypotheses and merely outputted noise.

      <!-- Analysis -->
      <h2>Result Analysis</h2>
      <h4>Shallow 1D CNN</h4>

      <p>
        The efficacy of style transfer with a shallow 1D CNN is quite intuitive when one considers how speech/music is
        encoded. Our spectrogram contains frequency data windowed at every 25ms or so. Common speech processing
        heuristics denote this as being the time for which a speech signal's statistics are <a
          href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.185.3622&rep=rep1&type=pdf">generally
          stationary</a>, and speech encoded at this time resolution gives a perceptually untarnished reconstruction.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus running a 1D time-convolution along a frequency channel would capture periodicity in the spectrogram at
        that frequency (an important component of speech/music) and potentially transfer over these characteristics.
        This part was somewhat accomplished by the 1D CNN.
      </p>
      <p>
        Where the 1D CNN failed is that it transferred over only one particular style of the style audio (a single style
        segment). The fact that the style signal as a whole was not stationary may be the cause of this. As such, this
        network might find more success in transferring over stationary style (fixed notes) onto content audio.

        Furthermore, adding in post-processing to remove what seems like white noise would also help with the
        comprehensibility of the content audio.
      </p>




      <h4>Wide-Shallow 2D CNN</h4>
      <p>
        Overall, the "comprehensible" rating of this architecture appears to match results from similar architectures.
        For example, consider
        the following style transfer from Dmitry Ulyanov, who also utilizes 4096 filters for texture synthesis:
      </p>
      <p>

        <audio controls="">

            href="https://dmitryulyanov.github.io/audio-texture-synthesis-and-style-transfer/">Source)</a></i>
      </p>
      <p>
        Clearly, both sources are present in the style transfer, but the artifacts sound garbled and imperfectly
        blended.
        Although the Ulyanov's sample does sound subjectively stronger, it does not contain lyrics and utilizes
        symphony instruments only, which likely makes the blending easier.
      </p>

            al.</a></i>
      </p>
      <p>
        One fascinating result is that the wide-shallow network had no prior training at all and yet still produced
        "comprehensible" results as defined by our qualitative scale. Although counterintuitive, similar results are
        actually seen in
        parallel areas of research. For example, Ustyuzhaninov et al. found that
        shallow, untrained convolutional architecture can achieve comparable results in texture synthesis to the trained
        state
        of the art (<a target="_blank" href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.00021.pdf">source</a>). They suggest that
        despite the
        randomized convolutions, "the Gram matrices computed from the feature maps of
        convolutional neural networks generically lead to useful summary statistics..." Since audio style transfer also
        requires matching the Gram Matrix of a source, it follows that the output was reasonable.
      </p>

      <h4>VGG 19</h4>
      <!-- <h4>Do the results make sense? Why or why not? Describe what kind of visualization/analysis you performed in order
        to verify that your results 1) are correct and 2) explain differences in performance from what was expected
        (e.g. what appeared in papers). Provide specific claims about why you think your model is or is not doing
        better, and justify those with qualitative and quantitative experiments (not necessarily just final accuracy
        numbers, but statistics or other data about what the model is doing).</h4> -->
      <p>
        The VGG-19 results were quite surprising given the hypothesis of spectrograms benefitting from edge detection.
        The audio is very garbled and wasn't very representative of any of either
        audio. We suspect it had to do with the reconstruction process since we were dealing with images of
        spectrograms instead of the raw values of the spectrograms. When we converted the spectrogram back, we lost a
        lot
        of phase information, which we attempted to correct for with a lossy guess of the phase (essentially
        interpolating
        it using an Inverse Fourier Transform). This results in the audio being garbled.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was also fascinating to see how
        the audio also degrades the more iterations we used. At 1 iteration, the audio sounds reasonable, but at 200
        iterations the tail end of the reconstruction becomes extremely garbled.
        The results make sense because a regular CNN wouldn't get phase information, and getting a decent reconstruction
        at all was fascinating to get. In order to verify we did style transfer correctly, we did a visual analysis of
        the
        spectrograms before and after style transfer as shown in the images in the results. Our loss was high over the
        different images but gradually got better; tuning the different parameters of style transfer might have
        resulted
        in less jerkiness to reduce loss and less of a garbled audio file.
        Our results seem to be in line with other <a target="_blank"
          href="https://dmitryulyanov.github.io/audio-texture-synthesis-and-style-transfer/">experiments</a> because
        VGG19 is not suited for audio, which is 1D, but VGG takes in 2D information in a heavily abstracted architecture.
