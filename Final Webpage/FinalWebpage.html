      <!-- Goal -->
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        For this project, we explored methodologies in style transfer for audio. Style transfer in audio encompasses
        challenges such as taking one genre of music and synthesizing it with traits from another genre.
        We were motivated to pursue this topic for a variety of reasons. First, style transfering music could help DJs make
        better blends of beats or transition between music easier.
        Furthermore, production music is a <a target="_blank"
          href="https://variety.com/2017/biz/news/production-music-billion-dollar-business-study-1202563223/">billion-dollar
          industry</a>. These pieces
        are typically placed in the background of marketing media and film. They are often
        simple pieces that could benefit with the extra volume in genre that deep learning like this
        provides.
      </p>
      <h2>Prior Art and Motivation</h2>
      <p>
        Currently, there are several approaches for musical style transfer involving
        <a target="_blank" href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/320754682_Audio_style_transfer">Wide, Shallow Convolutional Neural Networks</a>.
        We wanted to compare this pre-existing art with using deeper neural networks.
        Furthermore, there are a few approaches for musical style transfer involving <a target="_blank"
          href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.07575">VAE's and GAN's (1)</a>, <a
          href="https://medium.com/@suraj.jayakumar/tonenet-a-musical-style-transfer-c0a18903c910">VAE's and GAN's
          (2)</a>, and <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.07848.pdf">Wavenet Autoencoders</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
          While VAEs and GANs are certainly worth exploring as well, we focused on adding complexity to a shallow untrained neural
          net to explore how far this architecture can be pushed.
      </p>


      <h2>Approach</h2>

      <h4>Preprocessing Pipeline</h4>
      <p>

            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short-time_Fourier_transform#/media/File:Impact_STFT.png"
            target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>).
        </i>
      </p>
      <p>
        All of the architectures followed the same general preprocessing pipeline in order to perform style transfer.
        In order to make convolutional style transfer of a 1-dimensional waveform tractable, we represent audio tracks
        as a 2-dimensional image. This image is produced using a Short Time Fourier Transform (STFT), which
        encodes a long waveform into equal-length segments and computes frequency and phase content for each segment.
      </p>


      <h4>Architecture 1: Wide-Shallow Baseline</h4>
      <p>
        To establish a baseline, a wide-shallow architecture was implemented using the techniques in our reserach
        of prior art. This involved creating a neural network with one convolution of 4096 filters. As described in
        <a target="_blank" href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/320754682_Audio_style_transfer">Audio Style Transfer</a>
        by Grinsten, Duoung, Ozernov, and Perez, an untrained convolutional neural network can actually capture components
        of both the style and content.

        This figure shows the wide-shallow baseline architecture.
      </p>

      <h4>Architecture 2: Using VGG-19</h4>
      <p>
        <img style="height: 200px;" alt="" src="imgs/sujeeth/VGG-16-Visualization.png">

      </p>
      <p>
        As an extension the shallow approach, we experimented if adding <i>depth</i> using a pretrained neural network
        would yield better results. Although VGG-19 was pretrained on an extremely different problem set, its ability
        to detect primitives such as edges and basic shapes was hypothesized to be useful, even for style transfer.

      <h4>Architecture 3: [TODO (Hriday): Update your bit]</h4>
      <p>
        <b>TODO: Update</b>
        Hriday is working on a minimalist implementation that uses an untrained CNN for style transfer. The structure of
        this untrained network is what will be experimented with. Since musical style is somewhat more abstract than
        images, the results obtained via this untrained network will explore what it means to transfer style without
        stringent constraints.

      <br>

      <h2>Experimental Plan</h2>
      <h4>Dataset</h4>
      <p>
        One challenge with style transfer is that there is no objective way to evaluate the success of a style transfer. Thus,
        we standardized our evaluation by picking one style sample and one audio sample. For the content sample, we utilized
        jazz elevator music from <a target="_blank" href="https://www.bensound.com">Bensound</a>. For the style sample, we utilized
        a specifically selected track from the  <a target="_blank" href="http://freemusicarchive.org/">GTZAN Genre Collection</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <audio controls>
          <source src="audio/sujeeth/bensound-theelevatorbossanova.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
          Your browser does not support the audio element.
        </audio>
        <audio controls>
          <source src="audio/sujeeth/gtzan_hiphop_10s.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
          Your browser does not support the audio element.
        </audio>
        <br>
        <i>(left) BenSound elevator music sample. (right) GTZAN Hip Hop sample.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        These two sources were selected for a variety of reasons. First, the elevator music is primarily instrumental while the
        hip hop style source relies on lyrics and percussion. This constrains the difficulty of the style transfer
        since our architectures would not need to deal with issues such as music key differences or colliding vocal utterances.
        This also eases difficulty in subjectively evaluating a style transfer, since it would be very simple to hear
        whether a particular audio artifact comes from the content or style source.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, while there is no standardized way to evaluate a style transfer, we drafted the following scheme
        when rating the output of each architecture:
        <ul>
          <li><b>Human-Equivalent:</b> the outputted audio could plausibly have been created by a human in the desired style.</li>
          <li><b>Comprehensible:</b> the outputted audio contains easily-understood lyrics and well-blended instrumental artifacts.</li>
          <li><b>Fair:</b> the outputted audio contains some elements from content and style but lacks refinement in how they are blended.</li>
          <li><b>Incomprehensible:</b> the outputted audio captures neither content nor style and may have degraded to random noise.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <h4>Spectrogram Visuzalizations</h4>
      <p>
        <img height="300px" src="imgs/spectrogram_visualizations.png" />
      </p>
      <p>
        The above STFT images were fed into each architecture and then inverted to generate sample audio.
        Clearly, the content audio spectrogram appears very different than the style audio spectrogram.
      </p>

        Using the experiment scheme described in the experiment plan, we arrived at the following results.
        The Wide-Shallow Baseline contained elements from both content sources, although the mixing
        was erratic and lyrics come across muffled. Unfortunately, the VGG-19 experiment did not
        match our hypotheses and merely outputted noise. <b>TODO(Hriday): One sentencer here</b>

      <!-- Analysis -->
      <h2>Result Analysis</h2>
      <h4>Wide-Shallow Architecture</h4>
      <p>
        Overall, the "fair" rating of this architecture appears to match results from similar architectures. For example, consider
        the following style transfer from Dmitry Ulyanov, who also utilizes 4096 filters for texture synthesis:
      </p>

            href="https://dmitryulyanov.github.io/audio-texture-synthesis-and-style-transfer/">Source)</a></i>
      </p>
      <p>
        Clearly, both sources are present in the style trasnfer, but the artifacts sound garbled and imperfectly blended.
        Although the sample does sound subjectively stronger, Ulyanov's samples do not contain lyrics and utilize
        symphony instruments only, which likely makes the blending easier.
      </p>

      </p>
      <p>
        One fascinating result is that the wide-shallow network had no prior training at all and yet still produced
        "Fair" results as defined by our qualitative scale. Although counterintuitive, similar results are actually seen in
        parallel areas of resarch. For example, Ustyuzhaninov et al. found that
        shallow, untrained convolutional architecture can achieve comparable results in texture synthesis to the trained state
        of the art (<a target="_blank" href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.00021.pdf">source</a>). They suggest that despite the
        randomized convolutions, "the Gram matrices computed from the feature maps of
        convolutional neural networks generically lead to useful summary statistics..." Since audio style transfer also
        requires matching the Gram Matrix of a source, it follows that the output was reasonable.
      </p>

      <h4>VGG 19</h4>
      <!-- <h4>Do the results make sense? Why or why not? Describe what kind of visualization/analysis you performed in order
        to verify that your results 1) are correct and 2) explain differences in performance from what was expected
        (e.g. what appeared in papers). Provide specific claims about why you think your model is or is not doing
        better, and justify those with qualitative and quantitative experiments (not necessarily just final accuracy
        numbers, but statistics or other data about what the model is doing).</h4> -->
      <p>
        The VGG-19 results were quite surprising given the hypothesis of spectrograms benefitting from edge detection.
        The audio is very garbled and wasn't very representative of any of either
        audio. We suspect it had to do with the reconstruction process since we were dealing with images of
        spectrograms instead of the raw values of the spectrograms. When we converted the spectrogram back, we lost a lot
        of phase information, which we attempted to correct for with a lossy guess of the phase (essentially interpolating
        it using inverse fourier transform). This results in the audio being garbled.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was also fascinating to see how
        the audio also degrades the more iterations we used. At 1 iteration, the audio sounds reasonable, but at 200
        iterations the tail end of the reconstruction becomes extremely garbled.
        The results make sense because a regular CNN wouldn't get phase information, and getting a decent reconstruction
        at all was fascinating to get. In order to verify we did style transfer correctly, we did a visual analysis of the
        spectrograms before and after style transfer as shown in the images in the results. Our loss was high over the
        different images, but gradually got better, tuning the different parameters of style transfer might have resulted
        in less jerkiness to reduce loss and less of a garbled audio file.
        Our results seem to be in line with other <a target="_blank" href="https://dmitryulyanov.github.io/audio-texture-synthesis-and-style-transfer/">experiments</a>, because VGG19 is not suited for audio, which is 1D, but VGG takes in 2D information.
